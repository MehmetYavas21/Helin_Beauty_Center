                    <h3>Hair Removal</h3>
                    <p>Hair removal, also known as epilation or depilation, is the deliberate removal of body hair or head hair.</p>
                    <p>Hair typically grows all over the human body and can vary in thickness and length across human populations. Hair can become more visible during and after puberty and men tend to have thicker, more visible body hair than women. Both men and women have visible body hair on the head, eyebrows, eyelashes, armpits, genital area, arms, and legs. Men and some women may also have thicker hair growth on their face, abdomen, back, buttocks, anus, areola, chest, nasal, and ear. Hair does not generally grow on the lips, the underside of the hands or feet, or on certain areas of the genitalia.</p>

                    <h3>Hair Implantation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hair transplantation is a surgical technique that removes hair follicles from one part of the body, called the 'donor site', to a bald or balding part of the body known as the 'recipient site'. The technique is primarily used to treat male pattern baldness. In this minimally invasive procedure, grafts containing hair follicles that are genetically resistant to balding (like the back of the head) are transplanted to the bald scalp.

                    <p>
                        Since hair naturally grows in groupings of 1 to 4 hairs, current techniques harvest and transplant hair "follicular units" in their natural groupings. Thus modern hair transplantation can achieve a natural appearance by mimicking original hair orientation. This hair transplant procedure is called <strong>follicular unit transplantation (FUT)</strong>. Donor hair can be harvested in two different ways: strip harvesting, and <strong>follicular unit extraction (FUE)</strong>.

                    <h3>Manicure and Pedicure</h3>
                    <p>A <strong> manicure</strong> is a mostly cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail salon. A manicure usually consists of filing and shaping the free edge of nails, pushing and clipping (with a cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue (but limited to the cuticle and hangnails), treatments with various liquids, massage of the hand, and the application of fingernail polish. When the same is applied to the toenails and feet, the treatment is referred to as a pedicure. Together, the treatments may be known as a mani-pedi. Most nail polish can stay on nails for 2â€“3 days before another manicure is required for maintenance, if there is no damage done to it.</p>

                    <p>A pedicure is a cosmetic treatment of the feet and toenails, analogous to a manicure.</p>
                    <p><strong> Pedicures</strong> include care not only for the toenails; dead skin cells are rubbed off the bottom of the feet using a rough stone (often a pumice stone). Skincare is often provided up to the knee, including granular exfoliation, moisturizing, and massage.</p>

                    <h3>Indoor Tanning</h3>
                    <p>Indoor tanning involves using a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to produce a cosmetic tan. Typically found in tanning salons, gyms, spas, hotels, and sporting facilities, and less often in private residences, the most common device is a horizontal tanning bed, also known as a sunbed or solarium. Vertical devices are known as tanning booths or stand-up sunbeds.</p>
                    <p>First introduced in the 1920s, indoor tanning became popular with people in the Western world, particularly in Scandinavia, in the late 1970s.</p>
